# Web_Scraping_Indeed

The following project works with beautiful soup to scrape indeed.com to provide information about the salaries of various data science jobs across the world. This project aims to answer the question of whether or not data science as a field of work in the year 2020 is compensated equally across the planet as one would expect that such a lucrative industry would provide the same salary to individuals across the planet as the labour is highly skilled labour. In order to answer this question there was a need to determine the salary of data science postings across multiple locations, convert these salaries into a similar currency based on local purchasing power and then create a set of models to determine whether or not the adjusted salaries are tied to location.

NB: This web scraper was created in the summer of 2020, and it was quite common to have the salary posted alongside the job posting at this time. However currently, it is far more difficult to pull a salary with a web scrape as the salaries are not listed as frequently as they used to be listed on indeed.com.
